I implemented the solution using Flask, it was my first time using this API.
I wanted to try it out. The framework is pretty much straight and deploys the solutions. Later on I deployed the solution on linux Debian.

Description

1. PostMan to do the get/post tests and export the query script.
2. Flask for the development
3. For the unit test it worked great and I used the -v to see which ones were failing.
4. Between 'CONSTAINS IGNORING CASE' and 'MATCH', is the exact comparison. Match is the exact comparison.

Issues:
1. Python version installation
2. string comparion CASE INSENSITIVE
3. Windows vs Linux
4. Api Key error
5. Constains vs Match
6. Python methods are void - string.sort()
7. Created an Google console account
